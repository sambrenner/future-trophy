The Trophy of the Future
=======================

The Trophy of the Future (name subject to improvement) is the world's first internet-enabled trophy. It was created for my fantasy football league, the Westfield Athletics Club. It comprises an LED matrix embedded in polyurethane resin and mounted on a mahogany base. It is controlled by an Arduino YÃºn, which will pull NFL news, fantasy league scores and past league champion names from the internet to be displayed on the LED matrix.

Fabrication is mostly complete and I am now in the process of developing the software. Full documentation will be made available soon.
