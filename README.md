The Trophy of the Future
=======================

The Trophy of the Future is the world's first internet-enabled trophy. It was created for my fantasy football league, the Westfield Athletics Club. It comprises an LED matrix embedded in polyurethane resin and mounted on a mahogany base. It is controlled by an Arduino YÃºn, which pulls NFL news, fantasy league scores and past league champion names from the internet and displays them on the LED matrix.
